# Next Steps for Your EB-1A Application Journey

Congratulations on creating the **Power Platform Governance & Security Sentinel** project! This document outlines the strategic next steps to maximize the impact of this project for your EB-1A application.

## Immediate Actions (Week 1-2)

### 1. Build the Core Solution Components

While the repository structure and documentation are in place, the next critical step is to build the actual Power Platform components. This will make the project fully functional and deployable.

**Priority Tasks:**

*   **Design the Dataverse Data Model:** Create the custom tables outlined in the architecture document. Ensure proper relationships, security roles, and field types are configured.
*   **Develop the Power Automate Flows:** Build the scanning flows that use the Power Platform for Admins connectors. Start with the "Harvest All Power Apps" flow as a proof of concept.
*   **Create the Model-Driven App:** Build a basic version of the administrative interface that allows viewing of the harvested data.
*   **Export the Solution:** Once the core components are built, export them as a managed solution package and add it to the `solution` folder in the repository.

### 2. Create a Demo Video

A well-produced demo video is invaluable for showcasing your work. It provides a visual, engaging way for immigration officers, potential employers, and the community to understand the value of your project.

**What to Include:**

*   A brief introduction to the problem (governance challenges in Power Platform).
*   A walkthrough of the solution architecture.
*   A live demonstration of the scanning flows in action.
*   A tour of the Power BI dashboard showing real governance insights.
*   A call to action for community contributions.

Upload the video to YouTube and embed it in the README.md file.

### 3. Write Your First Article

Begin establishing yourself as a thought leader by writing an article based on this project. This is critical for the "authorship" criterion of EB-1A.

**Suggested Article Topics:**

*   **"The Hidden Risks of Citizen Development: Why Power Platform Governance Matters"** – A thought leadership piece that discusses the business and security implications of ungoverned Power Platform adoption.
*   **"Building a Security Sentinel for Microsoft Power Platform: A Technical Deep Dive"** – A technical article that walks through the architecture and implementation of your solution.
*   **"Automating Power Platform Governance with Power Automate and Dataverse"** – A how-to guide that demonstrates the key flows and data structures.

**Where to Publish:**

*   Your personal blog or website (if you have one).
*   [Medium](https://medium.com/) (with relevant tags like "Power Platform," "Governance," "Microsoft").
*   [Dev.to](https://dev.to/) (a developer-focused community).
*   [C# Corner](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/) (a well-regarded technical community).
*   [LinkedIn Articles](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/) (to reach a professional audience).

## Short-Term Actions (Month 1-2)

### 4. Engage the Community

Active community engagement is essential for generating citations, contributions, and recognition.

**Engagement Strategies:**

*   **Post on LinkedIn:** Share the project with a compelling narrative about why you built it and how it solves a real problem. Use relevant hashtags like #PowerPlatform, #Governance, #LowCode.
*   **Share on Twitter/X:** Tweet about the project and tag relevant accounts (e.g., @MSPowerPlat, @PowerApps, @PowerAutomate).
*   **Post in Power Platform Forums:** Share the project in the [Power Platform Community](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/), Reddit's [r/PowerPlatform](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerPlatform/), and other relevant forums.
*   **Present at User Groups:** Reach out to local or virtual Power Platform User Groups and offer to present your project. This can lead to citations and recognition.

### 5. Seek Endorsements and Testimonials

For EB-1A, letters of recommendation from recognized experts in your field are highly valuable. Start building relationships with influential figures in the Power Platform community.

**How to Approach This:**

*   Identify thought leaders, Microsoft MVPs, and community organizers in the Power Platform space.
*   Engage with their content (comment on their posts, share their articles).
*   Once you have a relationship, ask if they would be willing to review your project and provide a testimonial or endorsement.
*   If they find value in your project, they may cite it in their own work or recommend it to others.

### 6. Submit to Relevant Showcases and Awards

Look for opportunities to showcase your project in official or community-recognized venues.

**Potential Opportunities:**

*   **Microsoft Power Platform Community Showcase:** Submit your project to be featured.
*   **Hackathons and Competitions:** Participate in Power Platform hackathons or innovation challenges.
*   **Industry Awards:** Look for awards related to governance, security, or low-code development.

## Medium-Term Actions (Month 3-6)

### 7. Publish a Whitepaper or Research Paper

A formal whitepaper or research paper can serve as a citable academic or industry publication, which is highly valuable for EB-1A.

**Suggested Topics:**

*   **"A Framework for Automated Governance in Citizen Development Platforms"** – A research paper that positions your solution within the broader context of governance frameworks.
*   **"Quantifying the Risk of Ungoverned Power Platform Adoption: A Data-Driven Analysis"** – A paper that uses data from your solution to demonstrate the prevalence and severity of governance gaps.

**Where to Publish:**

*   Industry journals or magazines (e.g., *CIO Review*, *InfoQ*).
*   Academic conferences or workshops related to information systems, enterprise architecture, or security.
*   Pre-print servers like [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) or [SSRN](https://www.ssrn.com/) (for broader visibility).

### 8. Track Citations and Impact

As your articles and project gain traction, actively track citations and references to your work. This is critical evidence for EB-1A.

**How to Track:**

*   Use Google Scholar to create a profile and track citations of your articles.
*   Set up Google Alerts for your project name and key terms.
*   Monitor GitHub stars, forks, and issues as indicators of community interest.
*   Keep a record of any mentions in blogs, podcasts, or presentations.

### 9. Expand the Project with Community Contributions

Encourage community contributions to demonstrate that your project has broad impact and influence.

**Strategies:**

*   Label beginner-friendly issues as "good first issue" to attract new contributors.
*   Respond promptly to issues and pull requests.
*   Recognize contributors in the README and release notes.
*   Consider creating a "Contributors" page or hall of fame.

## Long-Term Actions (Month 6+)

### 10. Build a Portfolio of Related Projects

One project is good, but a portfolio of related projects demonstrates sustained excellence and leadership.

**Ideas for Related Projects:**

*   A Power Platform cost optimization tool.
*   A compliance reporting dashboard for GDPR, HIPAA, or other regulations.
*   An AI-powered anomaly detection system for Power Platform usage.

### 11. Establish Yourself as a Speaker and Educator

Speaking at conferences, webinars, and workshops is a powerful way to demonstrate extraordinary ability and influence.

**Opportunities:**

*   Apply to speak at Microsoft Ignite, Power Platform Conference, or regional events.
*   Host webinars or workshops on Power Platform governance.
*   Create a YouTube channel or podcast focused on Power Platform best practices.

### 12. Prepare Your EB-1A Evidence Package

As you accumulate achievements, start organizing your evidence for the EB-1A petition.

## Final Thoughts

This project is a strong foundation for your EB-1A application, but success will depend on consistent execution and strategic promotion. Focus on building a body of work that demonstrates not just technical skill, but also leadership, influence, and impact on the Power Platform community.

**Remember:** EB-1A is about proving "extraordinary ability." This means you need to show that you are one of the top professionals in your field. Every article, presentation, and contribution should reinforce this narrative.

Good luck, and feel free to reach out to the community for support along the way!
